— The phone supports both Java and Mophun. There is only one game in the Mophun folder, this is the Xfinity arcade game, which is well known to owners of Sony Ericsson phones. It was not possible to find any other games for this phone, on the official website of Mophun there was no mention of support for Voxtel devices, let's hope that this is temporary.

* Nokia N-Gage/QD doesn't support pure mophun, it's symbian after all. You probably meant that some games (such as Worms World Party) were written in Mophun, with libraries (such as Mophun.dll) added to them. But still, uploading a pure .mpn from Ensejż will not do much for you, because the game data is usually outside this file in separate folders, not in this file, as was the case with Sony Ericsson.
