* Nokia N-Gage/QD doesn't support pure mophun, it's symbian after all. You probably meant that some games (such as Worms World Party) were written in Mophun, with libraries (such as Mophun.dll) added to them. But still, uploading a pure .mpn from Ensej≈º will not do much for you, because the game data is usually outside this file in separate folders, not in this file, as was the case with Sony Ericsson.
